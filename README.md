# Born2beRoot - Virtual Server and WordPress Implementation 🚀 
[ Project Completion Date: 2021-12-06 ]

## Project Overview 📋
Born2beRoot documents my journey in crafting a secure virtual server, managed via VirtualBox or UTM. The challenge: setting up a WordPress website using PHP and lighttpd/MariaDB. This project showcases my prowess in Linux system administration, security, and web services. 💻🔒

## Core Configurations 🛡️
1. **Encrypted LVM:** Fortifying data security with encrypted partitions via Logical Volume Manager for enhanced flexibility. 🔐💽
2. **Security Measures:** SSH service on a dedicated port (4242), with root login disabled, for robust access controls. 🛡️🔑
3. **Firewall Setup:** Strict network access rules using UFW or firewalld, permitting traffic solely through the designated SSH port. 🌐🔥
4. **Password and Sudo Policies:** Stringent password policies coupled with precise sudo permissions for controlled and audited interactions. 🤖🔍

## Server Monitoring and Automation 📊
Developed `monitoring.sh`, a bash script offering a snapshot of server health and activity at startup and regular intervals. CPU load, memory usage, active connections, and last reboot time are highlighted for proactive server management. 📊🔄

## WordPress and Web Service Deployment 🌐
Expanded server capabilities with a fully-functional WordPress website. `lighttpd` as the web server, `MariaDB` for database management, and PHP for dynamic content processing. Practical experience in web server setup, database connectivity, and PHP configuration. 🌐🚀

## Project Conclusion 🎓
This project is a testament to my ability to navigate server complexities, enforce security best practices, manage network services, and deploy a widely-used content management system. It's not just about foundational knowledge; it's a demonstration of executing a multifaceted server environment from scratch. 🛠️💡🌟
